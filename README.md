# Real-time Air Quality Monitoring Dashboard

Project: Real-time Air Quality Monitoring Dashboard

Objective: Develop a data pipeline and dashboard to visualize real-time air quality data for major cities around the world.

Description: In this project, you will collect real-time air quality data from public APIs, store the data in a database, process the data, and visualize it in a user-friendly dashboard. Users should be able to view the current air quality index (AQI), main pollutants, and historical trends for major cities around the world.

Steps:

Data Collection:

Use the OpenAQ API (https://docs.openaq.org/) to fetch real-time air quality data for major cities.
You can use Python libraries such as requests or http.client to interact with the API and fetch data.
Data Storage:

Store the collected data in a database, such as PostgreSQL or MongoDB.
Design a suitable schema for your database to store the air quality data efficiently.
Use Python libraries like psycopg2 (for PostgreSQL) or pymongo (for MongoDB) to interact with the database.
Data Processing:

Set up a data processing pipeline using Apache Kafka or Apache Flink to process real-time air quality data.
Perform data cleaning, filtering, and aggregation tasks as needed.
Calculate key metrics like AQI, main pollutants, and historical trends.
Data Visualization:

Develop a web-based dashboard using a JavaScript library like D3.js, Plotly, or Chart.js to visualize the air quality data.
Use a web framework like Flask or Django to serve your dashboard as a web application.
Implement features like city selection, real-time updates, and historical data visualization.
Deployment:

Deploy your web application and database to a cloud provider like AWS, Google Cloud, or Heroku.
Set up continuous integration and deployment using GitHub Actions or another CI/CD tool.

Below. instructions for an MVP withSqlite and Flask app is given. Setting up either Apache Kafka or Apache Flink is skipped and instead implemented in the official project.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

## Step 1: Fetch air quality data from the OpenAQ API

1. Install the requests library: pip install requests
2. Create a Python script fetch_data.py with functions to fetch data from the OpenAQ API.

## Step 2:  Store the fetched data in an SQLite database

1. Install the sqlite3 module: pip install pysqlite3
2. Import the sqlite3 module in fetch_data.py.
3. Create a function to save fetched data in an SQLite database.
4. Call the save_data function in the fetch_data.py script.
5. Run the fetch_data.py script: python fetch_data.py

## Step 3: Create a Flask web application to visualize the data

1. Install Flask: pip install flask
2. Create a Python script app.py with the required modules and initialize the Flask app.
3. Create a function to query the data from the SQLite database.
4. Add a route to render the data on the web page.
