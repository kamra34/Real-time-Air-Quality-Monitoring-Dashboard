# Real-time Air Quality Monitoring Data Collection

This project fetches real-time air quality data for major cities using the OpenAQ API.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Getting Started

1. Install Python 3.x if you don't have it installed.

2. Clone the repository to your local machine.

3. Run the following command to fetch air quality data and store it in a `data.json` file:
python fetch_data.py


## How It Works

The `fetch_data.py` script fetches air quality measurements for a predefined list of cities from the OpenAQ API. It then stores the fetched data in a JSON file named `data.json`.

## Cities

The list of cities included in this project is as follows:

- Stockholm
- Oslo
- Helsinki
- Copenhagen
